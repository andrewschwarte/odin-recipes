    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      These wonderful heart-shaped cookies are filled with strawberry jam. I use
      a no-fail sugar cookie recipe to make them. I know you will enjoy them!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 (10 ounce) jar strawberry jam</li>
      <li>¼ cup powdered sugar, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        Cream sugar and butter with an electric mixer until fluffy, about 5
        minutes. Mix in egg and vanilla extract. Mix flour, baking powder, and
        salt together in a separate bowl and add to butter mixture. Mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        Put a handful of the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and
        roll to desired thickness. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Put the
        rolled dough, including the parchment paper, on a cookie sheet and
        refrigerate for 10 minutes or longer. Repeat the process with scraps
        after cutting cookies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        Cut 24 heart-shaped cookies of the same size from the dough. Use a
        smaller heart-shaped cookie cutter to cut a second hole in half of the
        cookies; this will be the window where the jam will show through.
        Transfer the cut cookies to a baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        Bake cookies in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 8 to 10
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack to allow to cool, 20 to 30
        minutes. Spread about 1/2 teaspoon of jam into the centers of the
        cookies without the heart-cut centers. Sprinkle powdered sugar on the
        rest of the cookies with the heart-cut centers, and mount onto the
        cookies with jam.
