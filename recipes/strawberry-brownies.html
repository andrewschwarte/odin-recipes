    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 (15.5 ounce) box strawberry cake mix</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided</li>
      <li>3 strawberries, chopped</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly grease an
        11x7-inch baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        Mix cake mix, melted butter, eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in a
        bowl until well combined. Spread mixture into an even layer in the
        prepared baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean when
        inserted into the center, 16 to 18 minutes. Allow brownies to cool in
        the pan for about 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        Meanwhile, puree strawberries and remaining teaspoon of vanilla extract
        in a food processor or with an immersion blender until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        Stir strawberry mixture into confectionerâ€™s sugar until smooth, adding
        extra sugar as necessary to reach the consistency of a glaze. Add salt
        and stir.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        Spread strawberry glaze evenly over the cooled brownies and let stand
        until completely cooled. Cut into 12 squares, or refrigerate until ready
        to serve.
