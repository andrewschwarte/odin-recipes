        <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>
          Prepare the Graham Cracker Crust: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175
          degrees C) with rack in lower third position. Line a 9- x 13-inch
          baking pan with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on the long
          sides. Lightly coat pan and foil with cooking spray.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>
          Stir together graham cracker crumbs, butter, sugar, cinnamon, and salt
          in a large bowl until combined and evenly moistened. Press mixture
          evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden and fragrant, 7 to 10
          minutes. Let cool slightly, about 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature
          to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
        </p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>
          Prepare the Cheesecake Filling: Beat cream cheese and sour cream in a
          stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed until
          fluffy and fully combined, 3 to 4 minutes. Beat in sugar and salt on
          medium speed until combined, about 1 minute.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p>
          Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating on low speed just until combined after
          each addition and stopping to scrape down sides of bowl with a rubber
          spatula as needed, 1 to 2 minutes total. Add heavy cream and vanilla
          extract; beat on low speed just until combined.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 7</h4>
        <p>
          Pour Cheesecake Filling into cooled Graham Cracker Crust. Evenly
          dollop apple butter over Cheesecake Filling; using a butter knife or
          small spatula inserted about halfway into filling, decoratively swirl
          apple butter using zig-zag motions until desired distribution.

      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 8</h4>
        <p>
          Place baking pan inside a large roasting pan and place in preheated
          oven. Pour boiling water into roasting pan so it reaches halfway up
          the sides of the baking pan. Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C)
          until cheesecake slightly jiggles when shaken but is set around the
          edges, 35 to 40 minutes.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 9</h4>
        <p>
          Turn off oven and leave oven door cracked open 7 to 8 inches; let
          cheesecake cool in oven for 30 minutes. Remove roasting pan from oven
          and carefully remove cheesecake from water bath. Let cool in pan at
          room temperature 30 minutes, then cover and refrigerate until
          completely chilled, at least 4 hours or up to overnight.

      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 10</h4>
        <p>
          Using foil overhang as handles, lift the cheesecake out of the pan and
          place it onto a cutting board. Cut it into 12 (3 x 2 1/2-inch)
          rectangles. Serve chilled.
